# Trainee Repository with Tasks

Main idea behind this repository is to add some tasks a trainee can do for learning purpose.
Each task should be done by using the internet, the tool documentation, an existing project or a wiki (in your company maybe?).

For php projects, a prepared composer.json file will be implemented when needed. Install [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download) if not installed already.

Big thanks to [xyNNN](https://github.com/xyNNN) for this idea.

@todo implement automatically generating index
